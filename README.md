# AuroraDropCompanion alpha 0.0.03a

Windows companion application for AuroraDrop
https://github.com/uklooney/AuroraDrop

Currently a very early (near non existant) version.
You will need to change the COM port in the source for now, and compile to suit your particular setup. Will fix this if someone cares.

## Latest Updates

v0.0.03a
Updated FFT datagram length from 96 bytes to 128 bytes.

v0.0.02a
Added experimental (slow) support for network streaming in place of usb cable and serial comms.
