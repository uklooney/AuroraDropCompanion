# AuroraDropCompanion alpha 0.0.04a

Windows companion application for AuroraDrop
https://github.com/uklooney/AuroraDrop

Currently a very early version.
You will need to change the COM port(s) and TCP port(s) in the source for now (App.xaml.cs), and compile to suit your particular setup. Will sort this properly if someone cares.
Currently, supports up to two serial + two tcp clients.

## Latest Updates

v0.0.04a
Re-wrote serial comms.
UDP client support removed.
TCP client support added. Needs a good wifi connection to stream well.

v0.0.03a
Updated FFT telegram length from 96 bytes to 128 bytes.

v0.0.02a
Added experimental (slow) support for network streaming in place of usb cable and serial comms.
